var raw = `No one saw him disembark in the unanimous night, no one saw the bamboo canoe sink into the sacred mud, but in a few days there was no one who did not know that the taciturn man came from the South and that his home had been one of those numberless villages upstream in the deeply cleft side of the mountain, where the Zend language has not been contaminated by Greek and where leprosy is infrequent.

What is certain is that the grey man kissed the mud, climbed up the bank with pushing aside (probably, without feeling) the blades which were lacerating his flesh, and crawled, nauseated and bloodstained, up to the circular enclosure crowned with a stone tiger or horse, which sometimes was the color of flame and now was that of ashes.

This circle was a temple which had been devoured by ancient fires, profaned by the miasmal jungle, and whose god no longer received the homage of men.

The stranger stretched himself out beneath the pedestal. He was awakened by the sun high overhead. He was not astonished to find that his wounds had healed; he closed his pallid eyes and slept.

He knew that this temple was the place required for his invincible intent; he knew that his immediate obligation was to dream.

The purpose which guided him was not impossible, though supernatural.

At first, his dreams were chaotic; then they became dialectic in nature.

After nine or ten nights he understood with bitterness that he could expect nothing from passive pupils.

He understood that modeling the incoherent matter of dreams was the most difficult task.

He dreamed almost immediately, with his heart throbbing.

He dreamed an entire man.

The dreamed one awoke.

With relief, humiliation, and terror, he understood that he also was an illusion, that someone else was dreaming him.`;
